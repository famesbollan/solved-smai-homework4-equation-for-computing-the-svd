<h1>1           Objective Question</h1>

Consider the equation for computing the SVD:

A = UΣV<sup>∗</sup>

SVD decomposition breaks down any invertible transformation into a composition of three geometrical transformations: rotation, scaling, and reflection. True or False?

2           Subjective Question [2 marks]

Consider the tutorial notebook ‘LSI and SVD.ipynb’ and answer the following questions based on your observation.

<ol>

 <li>Briefly explain the plot of the singular values <em>s </em>(or in other words, what can we say about the singular values based on its plot).</li>

 <li>Are the <em>U </em>and <em>Vh </em>matrix orthonormal? How will you verify this?</li>

</ol>

<h1>3           Programming Question</h1>

Implement a movie recommendation system using SVD. Given the ‘Movielens 100k’ data set, your task is to implement a recommendation system using SVD and compute the root mean squared error of the test set. The excercise notebook ‘Recommender System with SVD.ipynb’ provides you with the starter code.
